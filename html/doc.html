        <p>SVG proved to become increasingly pleasant to use as the project progressed. For this project Kek decided to use SVG to create smileys for the "Joy" artwork. SVG allows for easy painting of paths and can create objects like circles in simpler ways than Canvas. The smileys are made up of one big circle with smaller circles as eyes and half circles as the mouth. To add complexity, Kek has also added tears to some of the smileys.</p>

        <p>This project has a mouseover event in the "Mona" artwork, which reveals several Canvas elements. Canvas allows for 2 ways of drawing gridmaps pixel by pixel, either through making a square, or making a stroke. This project tries to use of both to create several different well known shapes, as well as an improvised one.</p>

    <div class="doc" id="doc3">
        <p>The project uses flexbox and gridbox in different ways through the project, as there has been substantial experimentation with these to learn their strengths and weaknesses. Gridbox is used for this doc, and for the "Joy" artwork to ensure that the smileys are all over the page. Flexbox is used less for this project, as Kek found that his artistic side was limited by flexbox' properties. Flexbox is excellent for putting many elements on a line, or wrapping them over a line. However, for Kek's artistic mindset, using grids to place elements in a grid proved to be much simpler.</p>

    <div class="doc" id="doc4">
        <p>For this project, JQuery is used for handling mouse events. This includes hovers and following the cursor around in the "Mona" artwork. She is also clickable, clicking her adds a little smiley mouth to her face. JQuery is great for simplyfying simple codesnips that otherwise require some form of JavaScript implementation. Being able to call a single line of code for handling things like a mouseover event makes DOM manipulation a breeze. </p>

        <p>As for how the project was balanced in design, it was a struggle. Kek tried his hardest to create a fluid experience which had smooth interactions and painted elements that were responsive both in several browsers and phone view, and also when zoomed in/out. Cross-site testing has been performed on Chrome and Edge through WebStorms integrated web-function. All links used for the project can be found below, mostly w3schools, tutorialscampus, codepen and stackoverflow. The index site also has elements reused from a previous project that Kek has made. Kek knows the artworks aren't that similar, but wants to add a note that he learnt alot from making them either way, and making 2 different artworks was way more fun.</p>
